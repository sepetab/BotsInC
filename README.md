### Time to code
As local time varies between regions, computers typically maintain time in UTC. This, for example, allows time to be used across the internet without ambiguity. However, times in UTC must be converted to local time to be convenient for humans.

get_local_time is a function in time2code.c that does this conversion

For example, in March 2018, Sydney uses Australian Eastern Daylight Time which is UTC+11, so the function returns 1730.
